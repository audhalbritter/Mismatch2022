## Questions & Hypothesis

Will an increase in mismatch between plants and their pollinators decrease reproductive output and affect population viability?

We expect reproductive output to decrease with increasing “mismatch”


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 8)
knitr::read_chunk("ImportantFigures.R")

```

```{r loadPhenology}



```

```{r setTheme}
th <- theme_bw(base_size = 12)

```

## Site set up
```{r, eval = TRUE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("SiteE02.JPG")

```



## Phenology
```{r PhenologyAllStages, eval = TRUE}

```

## Temperature
```{r TemperatureData, eval = TRUE}

```


## Pollination
```{r PollinationAllStages, eval = TRUE}

```

## Pollination
```{r PollinationSummary, eval = TRUE}

```


## Differnce in peak flower and visit
```{r MismatchPlot, eval = TRUE}

```


## Number of ripe seeds
```{r NrRipeSeed, eval = TRUE}

```



## Difficulties


- We did not use a snowmelt gradient: site with different timing of snowmelt
- Many plots had no flowers inside (but many outside)
- Sheep! Need to build fences from the start!
- Data from early and mid stage are ok. Late was not ok!

- Counting pollinators was challenging
- Should we distinguish between different pollinators? (tiny flies, blosterfluer, vanlige fluer)


- Did hand pollination work?


## What to do next?
- Fence all the plots properly
- Start observations earlier?
- Hope for a better summer
- More effort for the hand pollination
